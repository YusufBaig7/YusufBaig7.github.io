Hey there! Welcome to my site, where I share my journey in Artificial Intelligence and related fields. I am a computer science graduate student interested in using AI to address real-world challenges, particularly natural language processing in low-resource languages.

I am pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at New York University (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences), where my coursework includes Natural Language Processing, Operating Systems, and Programming Languages. I have had the privilege of contributing to research at the [Multimodal Digital Media Analysis (MIDAS) Lab](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/) under [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=WAChZv4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ&hl=en). I focused on Legal Judgment Prediction using Graph Neural Networks and zero-shot methods leveraging Large Language Models. This experience solidified my passion for applying cutting-edge AI to solve impactful societal problems.

Previously, I worked as a Software R&D Engineer at Carl Zeiss under [Dr. Daniel Weiss](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Weiss-20), developing and optimising image processing algorithms for critical applications like 3D volume analysis in aerospace. During my undergraduate studies at Manipal Institute of Technology, I explored Computational Intelligence under [Dr. Sanjay Singh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VBj6NyUAAAAJ&hl=en), including developing a Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation framework for Hindi and Hinglish and creating an Optical Character Recognition system for Arabic prescriptions.
