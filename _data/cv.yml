    - title: Research Assistant – Legal AI
      institution: Multimodal Digital Media Analysis (MIDAS) Lab, Delhi
      year: 2022 - 2024
      description:
        - Implemented GNNs for Legal Judgment Prediction, leveraging node classification techniques with advanced
          XLNet-based embeddings to model judicial case structures, achieving a macro F1 score of 75%.
        - Developed and evaluated zero-shot Legal Judgment Prediction methods using multiple LLMs, leveraging
          techniques such as Rhetorical Role structuring, Contextualized Case-aware Templates (CCaT), and metadata
          integration to simulate judicial reasoning processes, achieving a 10% improvement in F1 score compared to
          traditional approaches.
    - title: Software R&D Engineer – Image Processing and Backend
      institution: Carl Zeiss R&D, India
      year: 2022 - 2024
      description:
        - Studied and implemented advanced image processing techniques, mainly calculating a 3D volume’s Contrast
          Discrimination Function and Modulation Transfer Function for an Aerospace client.
        - Formulated and executed a complex set of algorithms targeting pixel intensity adjustments, resulting in a
          streamlined workflow that saved an average of 10 hours in a 30-hour project timeframe during the image
          processing phase.
